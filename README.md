# Data-Manipulation-and-Classification-Tool
This Python application provides an interactive interface for data manipulation, filling missing values, normalization, and classification evaluation using pandas, tkinter, and other libraries.

# Purpose
The application is designed to assist users in performing various operations on datasets, including:

->Displaying datasets
->Filling missing values
->Normalizing the data
->Conducting classification evaluation

# Features
Show Data Set: Displays the imported dataset in a tabular format.
Fill Missing Values: Provides options to fill missing values in the dataset.
Normalize The Data: Normalizes the dataset values to a standard scale.
Classification & Evaluation: Conducts classification evaluation on the dataset.
Exit: Closes the application.

# Usage
Click "Show Data Set" to import and display the dataset in the first tab.
Use "Fill Missing Values" to fill missing data, either for the entire dataset or a specific column.
Normalize the dataset using the "Normalize The Data" button.
Perform classification and evaluation using the "Classification & Evaluation" button.
Close the application using the "Exit" button.

# Structure
The application GUI is structured into three main frames:

Left Frame: Contains buttons for various operations.
Center Frame: Displays the imported dataset and normalized data.
Right Frame: Displays the classification evaluation results.

# Dependencies
The application uses the following libraries:

tkinter: For the graphical user interface.
pandas: For data manipulation and handling datasets.
pandastable: For displaying the dataset in a table format.
numpy: For numerical operations on data.

# Notes
Ensure that the dataset is in a compatible format before importing.
The application provides interactive options for data manipulation and classification, allowing users to visualize and evaluate dataset changes.
Feel free to modify the application for specific dataset operations or add further functionalities as needed.
